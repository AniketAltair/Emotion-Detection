## Mood Detection Using openCV and Keras


Hello guys, this is **Aniket.** This is my first blog.

At first, what content to share with you ,was very head-aching  question. Why not go through my Deep learning journey ( as of now, still i am a learner, neither a pro nor a noob ) and all the projects I have made and share with you guys?" Hope you like my Blog,  and motivate me to write more content.


Coming to the main part, I will guide you step by step, to build your First Mood Detection Project in Python using Keras and openCV . Before Starting Let me clear that you need to have Basic Understanding of Python, How to import Images from .csv files using Pandas  and also basic understanding of Keras and OpenCV python Library. But if you don't know any of these,  don't worry, Down here are some useful links:-

Python: https://www.w3schools.com/python/

Opencv: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/opencv/index.htm

Keras: https://elitedatascience.com/keras-tutorial-deep-learning-in-python

Pandas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vtpUklKlsk


Without any further delay, let's  get started.


First of all, you need to download this training Dataset in your computer, which is in .csv format. The file contains, 3 columns (emotion, Usage and pixels) and near about 34000 training and test data set, Comprising of 7 distinct emotions,namely, angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad and surprise.

 Now, first of all after cloning you need to run train.py file to train the dataset.
 This will generate the .h5 file where our trained model is stored.
 Now run the Emodet.py file, look in the camera and know your mood.
